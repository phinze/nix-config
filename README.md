# My Nix Configs

This repository contains my Nix configuration files for all of my machines. This includes NixOS VMs and MacOS laptops managed by nix-darwin.

## How I work

I do most of my work SSHed into a NixOS VM running in my homelab. I use a `tmux` and `neovim` based development environment.

## Using this repo

These configs are not designed for anybody else but me to use, but you're welcome to look through them and ask questions if you like.

Reading other people's published configs is a major part of how I've learned Nix, and so I publish my configs in that same spirit of shared knowledge and learning.
